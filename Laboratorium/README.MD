* `doctors_db`  -  database for doctors
* `rooms_db` - database for examination-rooms
* `doctors` - micro data service for doctors
* `rooms` - micro data service for examination-rooms
* `roomselector` - micro app service for examination-rooms-selector

## Local (not fully)

In order to run project you have to run databases from docker-compose.yml (`doctos_db` and `rooms_db` ). Next compile all micro services in DEBUG and everything should work.
